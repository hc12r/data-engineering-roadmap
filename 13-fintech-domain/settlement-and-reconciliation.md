# Settlement and Reconciliation

- End-of-day vs intraday processes, cut-off times, and settlement windows.
- Matching strategies: deterministic keys, fuzzy matching, tolerances, and netting.
- Break management: queueing, prioritization, and SLAs for resolution.
- Controls: 4-eyes, audit trails, and reconciliation dashboards.
- Data: statements, ledgers, GL posting, fees/commissions, and chargebacks.
