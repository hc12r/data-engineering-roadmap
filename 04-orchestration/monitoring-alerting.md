# Monitoring and Alerting for Orchestrated Pipelines

- Metrics: task duration, success rate, SLA misses.
- Alerts: email/Slack/on-call for failures and SLAs.
- Logging: centralize logs; add task-level context and correlation IDs.
- Tracing: use OpenLineage/OTel where possible.
- Dashboards: Airflow UI, Grafana, custom BI.
